## Insights:


##1 the results of chisquare test, this test basically compares the observed value with the expected value

## in the given case, it tells us whether the variation in the data is explained by the model
## that is structural model we have just built is good enough or not
## since the p-value is close to zero, it implies that 


## 2nd impact of each independent variable

## we should know that each variable has a significance in the model prediction. we should always avoid using variables that have insignificant impact


## from the above summary details, all p-values are negligible implying that there is significant impact of eachvariable on to the job performance


##  3nd Quanititive effect of variables


## all regressors (social, intel, motivation) have a positive impact on the job performance
## however, out of all, motivation has the biggest influence( that is 2.758) a 1-unit change in motivation leads to a 2.78 units change in job performance.

## There are two measured variables in latent motivation variable
## out of them , Hours worked plays the best role in prediction.
